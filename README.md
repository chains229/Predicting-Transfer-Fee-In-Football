This project is undertaken to create a predictive model for the transfer value of football players. Football, also known as soccer, is a team sport played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players. The game is played using a ball on a rectangular field with two goals at either end. The objective of the game is to score points by getting the ball into the opponent's goal. Apart from the goalkeeper, players are not allowed to intentionally use their hands or arms to play the ball. The team with more goals at the end of the match is the winner. It is one of the most beloved sports in the world. Football is played at a professional level worldwide, with millions of people attending matches and billions watching on television. According to a survey conducted by FIFA in 2001, more than 240 million people from over 200 countries regularly play football.

In addition to being a passion for fans, from an economic perspective, football has become a market valued at over £22 billion (as of 2015). Football has made significant contribution to the global economy in general and many individual countries as well. Countries strive to host the World Cup, aiming to leverage opportunities for cultural promotion, tourism, and economic growth. Major tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League and the Premier League also generate substantial revenues. According to Deloitte's 2018 report, the European football market is valued at approximately £25 billion.

Nowadays, as economic matters are increasingly emphasized, football teams face a new challenge: they must improve their performance on the field while also generating economic profits. Player transfers have also become an issue that every football team is concerned about. Modern football teams aim to calculate the costs as well as the revenue from player transfers in order to maximize their efficiency. Predicting the value of a player has now become an extremely important issue for clubs, investors, and stakeholders.

Predicting the transfer value of players is a complex task that requires a combination of football knowledge and forecasting ability. However, with the advancement of technology and the use of machine learning and deep learning methods, predicting the transfer value of football players has become more feasible and promising.

Our project will utilize football player data to construct a model for predicting transfer fees. Each player's data encompasses fundamental information (age, height, playing position, etc.), data about the performances on the pitch (number of goals, assists, injuries, etc.), individual and team awards for the player. The target attribute we will employ is the transfer value of players based on Transfermarkt's estimations.

Transfermarkt is a website specialized in data and information about players, clubs, and the transfer market. Transfermarkt's player valuation system is highly reliable and widely recognized, being extensively consulted by professionals and football enthusiasts worldwide. Subsequently, we will employ machine learning techniques to make predictions about a player's transfer fee and then compare these predictions with the target attribute to assess the model's accuracy.

Effectively predicting the transfer value of players will provide football teams with a more detailed and clear perspective when making transfer-related decisions. The prediction outcomes can be utilized to support the investment decisions of clubs, helping them to recruit valuable players at reasonable prices or avoid acquiring overpriced players with insufficient capabilities.
